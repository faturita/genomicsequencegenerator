# GenomicSequenceGenerator
Do not expect too much from this...Sorry for dissapointing you...

However you can get this code and use it to play a little bit with DNA sequences and proteins.  You can generate a set of random-generated genomes and challenge your friends to decode proteins and identify species (I wonder who'd ever want to do this...).  Anyway, the codon convertion tables can be handy.


## Install

You have to have ruby installed on your box to run this stuff.
